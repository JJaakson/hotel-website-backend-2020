    //todo A
    // What is a server?
    // Answer: A server is a computer equipped with specific programs and
    // hardware that enables it to offer services to other computers on its network.

    //todo B
    // What is the difference between build server and production server?
    // Answer: The build server is used to build everyone's code when it is checked in.
    // A production server is used to deploy and host live websites or Web applications.

    //todo C
    // What is docker?
    // Answer: Docker is a tool that allows developer to easily deploy their applications in containers
    // to run on the host operating system. OPTION 2 : Docker is an open source tool that uses containers to create,
    // deploy, and manage distributed applications.

    //todo D
    // Name and explain docker container benefits over virtual machine setup (java jar as system process and installed nginx)
    // 1) Containers are 'lightweight', meaning they consume less CPU, RAM and Disk resources, you can put two to three
    // times as many applications on a single server with containers than you can with a virtual machine setup.
    // 2) Containers boot up a lot faster than Virtual machines.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain docker container drawback over virtual machine setup (java jar as system process and installed nginx)
    // 1) Containers cannot provide security at a commendable level. Virtual machine setups are more secure.

    //todo F
    // Name and describe tools for docker architecture
    // 1) Docker. Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
    // 2) AWS. AWS provides developers and admins a highly reliable, low-cost way to build, ship, and run distributed applications at any scale.

    //todo G
    // Name and explain why are companies slow in moving existing systems to docker architecture (do not explain why docker is bad)
    // 1) Companies don't want to figure out newer solutions, they want to do things the way they know how to do and are familiar with.
    // 2) A lot of companies have trouble adopting containers because they attempt to shoehorn their existing VM practices into containers.
