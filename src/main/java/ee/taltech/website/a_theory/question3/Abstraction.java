    //todo p1
    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is abstraction? (P.S It has nothing to do with keyword abstract)
    // Answer: It is making something complicated and making it easy to use. For example, a TV-remote, it has simple
    //         buttons but underneath the buttons is a complex control mechanism.

    //todo p2
    // Create an abstraction of an animal of your choice.
    // It should have at least 1 property and 1 method.
    // Create it as a real java class inside this package.
