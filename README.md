# Backstory
* A web application for a hotel. This was a project in one of my classes during university. Spring Boot and Java was used as a back-end REST api, Angular was used to create front-end and H2 Databases was used to store information.

# Setup guide
* Clone back-end and front-end projects to your IDE
* Run back-end by running WebsiteApplication.java under the package ee.taltech.website
* Run front-end by entering ng command "ng run". (If it doesn't work you need to install npm)
* Open http://localhost:4200/booking in your browser

## Website guide
* Use the navigation bar to navigate through different views
* Under "Rooms" view you can select a room and see the details to that room
* Under "Contact" view you get information about the hotel
* Under "Booking" view you can check availabilty of rooms and book them
* Under "Search" view you can search for existing bookings
